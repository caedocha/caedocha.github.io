## Introduction

I recently became the technical lead of my team. With this change of role, many new challenges have arisen. Among them include leading people, making sure the team is working well together, and that my teammates are motivated to complete our projects in the best way possible.

A few days after assuming the role, I decided to have coaching sessions with the senior developers. We discussed many interesting topics that could help us become a better team, as well as better individual contributors. These included ownership, understanding the big picture, haggling, craftsmanship, writing skills, and more.

Let's start with ownership. To me, ownership is the foundation that allows people to be in control of their day-to-day job and career development. Things flow much better if you are mindful of the role ownership plays in your work.

Think of it like being the captain of a ship. You would be directly in charge of selecting a destination, making sure the ship stays afloat, and ultimately navigating there. On the other side of the coin, if a storm breaks, you would also be responsible for finding a safe harbor... or going down with the ship should things take a worse turn.

Here are a few tips that I have learned and used to nourish my sense of ownership. Just a word of caution: I still have a lot to learn and this is my humble opinion. I just thought writing this essay would be an interesting challenge for me.

### It is a mindset anyone can have

Anyone can be the captain of their own boat. You, as a professional, are responsible for your career, for your successes and failures. You are the one that decides which are the goals you want to reach, the knowledge and skills you need to learn, how you market yourself, how you build bonds with other folks, etc.

### Have commitment, constancy, and perseverance

Any worthy goal is going to take time and a lot of effort. Keep taking steps towards it. Some of them will be big, others will be small ones. Appreciate all of them but especially the small ones. Those are the ones that will keep you motivated most of the way.
Not all of the steps will be thrilling and full of enjoyment, some of them will be dull, tedious, or daunting. You will have to power through them. Always remember that after the storm, the sun comes out.

### Your reputation is key

Your reputation will precede you and is your brand. Because of that, you have to intentionally design it. Decide what are the values and principles you want people to relate your name with. Select the habits and behaviors that will accomplish this. I would expect that you strive to be the best manifestation of yourself. Whichever form it takes for you. So make sure everyone around you knows that.
For example, if you want to be known as someone reliable because it is important for you.
Then always arrive on time and if it is not possible, inform you are going to be late and apologize. Then think about how to avoid being late again. 

### Be accountable and reliable

People need to know that you can be counted on, you cannot be flaky. When you get a new responsibility - it can be the biggest of endeavors or the smallest of chores - you are the one that takes it all the way to the finish line. However, you have to take responsibility if it fails. You must be worthy of receiving trust. Earn it.

### Project yourself into the world

I like using this phrase because it denotes that you are extending a piece of yourself into the real world. It implies intention and purpose in your actions. None of your actions are random if you think it this way. It is important to envision big goals but it is even more important to take action. Be doing a lot of things. It does not matter if they are big or small. For example, writing this article is my first effort of doing this in a long time. It is hard as hell, by the way. 

### Be self-sufficient

I like stoicism because it teaches you that the only thing you are in control of is your thoughts. This constraint forces us to be the only ones capable of developing and designing our careers. Do not expect anyone figuring out things for you. The upside is that you have complete freedom of deciding whatever you want to do. Remember, if you are the captain of the boat, you get to pick the course. However, if you do not do so, you will end up drifting to whichever place the currents take you.

### Have an open and flexible mind.

Make sure you mediate and introject on a daily basis. Be grateful for where you are right now but also, do not be satisfied with your status quo. It is a delicate balance. Always question yourself why you are doing whatever you are doing and if it corresponds with your purpose. Imagine that this is like reading the charts and correcting the course if needed.

### Have principles and faith

You need to ask yourself what are the principles that you use at work. They can be ethical ones like honesty and integrity. They can be technical too. They are the ones that you use to define your craft. They are the compasses you use to guide your decisions. 
Finally, faith means trusting that the decision you are making is the best one while taking into consideration the context you are in. It is like jumping into a pond trusting you won’t hit the rocks.

## Conclusion

My knowledge of seafaring is quite limited. However, I used the captain and the boat metaphors because I found they captured in a simple way what I think ownership of your work is about. Just remember that you are the captain of your ship. It is up to you to reach a safe harbor.
